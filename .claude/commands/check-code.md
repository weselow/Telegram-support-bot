I'm ready to create this PR. Please:
1. Review test coverage
2. Check for silent failures
3. Verify code comments are accurate
4. Review any new types
5. General code review
6. Security code review. 

Then, provide a feedback, what recommendations we should apply, what should reject as over-engeneering, what should save as technical debt in backlog @docs\backlog\technical-debt to apply in the future.
